Work Experience
----------

2019-Present 
:   **Quantitative Analyst**
@   **[FINCAD](http://fincad.com) Metro Vancouver, BC**

* IBOR transition: Worked on overnight rates (SOFR, FedFunds, EONIA, etc.)
and term rates curve calibrations with meeting (FOMC, ECB, etc.) dates
jumps using [FINCAD Python SDK](http://fincad.com/solutions).

* Provided professional services for one of the major US banks on: (1) EOD
curves building: Wrote Python services and REST API to build discount,
forward rates and FX forward curves with [FINCAD
libraries](http://fincad.com/solutions) according to client's instrument
selection. (2) [ARR](http://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc) Calculator as part
of transition to SOFR: Wrote API and UI with Python and Dash to present
accrual interest details with models built by [FINCAD
libraries](http://fincad.com/solutions), that support various spread
methodologies and features, including look-back, lockout and observation
shift, etc.

* Work on a new REST-based, containerized, cloud-hosted calculation engine
backed by [FINCAD libraries](http://fincad.com/solutions). Build
framework and develop features for modeling, valuation and risk
reporting in all asset classes.


2017-2019 
:   **AVP, Model Validation**
@   **Citibank, N.A.Tampa, FL** 

* Validated rates derivatives pricing models in support of G10, FXLM, Muni
desks for valuation, risks, PnL attribution and hedging. Assessed the
theoretical soundness of models and tested the numerical accuracy,
stability, and convergence of models. Checked implementation correctness
and developed benchmark models to effectively challenge against them.

* Identified and managed model limitations. Assessed and quantified
severity of model limitations and managed associated compensating
controls. Wrote high quality validation reports with LaTeX, discussed
findings with stakeholders, and maintained a close partnership with
other functions.

* Worked with various interest rates models: LMM, HW, Displaced SABR,
Vanna Volga, Copula, Markov functional, etc. Worked with various rates:
LIBOR, CMS, OI, BMA, Quanto indices, etc. Example projects: Vanilla and
Exotic BMA options, Compounded OI leg with gearing and spread, Commodity
CVA model, etc.

2015-2017 
:   **Lecturer in Mathematics**
@   **The Ohio State University Columbus, OH**

* Designed and taught undergraduate math courses such as calculus, linear
algebra, ODE and PDE. Made persistent efforts to understand the students
and placed great importance on real world examples and applications.
Skilled in explaining abstract theoretical concepts to non-expert
audiences in easy-to-understand language. Co-organized and participated
in a stochastic calculus for finance reading club.
